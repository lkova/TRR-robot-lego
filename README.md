# TRR robot pick and place manipulator

TRR robot arm manipulator using Lego Mindstorm.

The idea of the competition was the following.
	1. Design a TRR robot arm from Lego Mindstorm
	2. Connect to Matlab
	3. Write kinematics and motion algorithm
	4. Create color based object detection (detection object was circular)
	5. Put object in assigned containter
	5. Create GUI interaface for this application

## Solution 

Unfortunately we didn't have containers in the test, therefore we took objects with hands
