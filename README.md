# TRR robot pick and place manipulator

TRR robot arm manipulator using Lego Mindstorm.

The idea of the competition was the following. <br/>
	1. Design a TRR robot arm from Lego Mindstorm <br/>
	2. Connect to Matlab <br/>
	3. Write kinematics and motion algorithm <br/>
	4. Create color based object detection (detection object was circular) <br/>
	5. Put object in assigned containter <br/>
	5. Create GUI interaface for this application <br/>

## Solution 

Unfortunately we didn't have containers in the test, therefore we took objects with hands
